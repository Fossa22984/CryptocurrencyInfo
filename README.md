# CryptocurrencyInfo

I used CoinCap API. CryptingUp doesn't work, CoinGecko doesn't have candles. But CoinCap also has problems with candles. It returns nothing.
I used WPF .NET 6.0.

My application supports the following functionality:

• It's a multi-page application with navigation.

• The main page displays the top N currencies by popularity on some market.

• Page with the ability to view detailed information about the currency.

• Page with the ability to view detailed information about the market.

• Possibility of searching for currency by name.

• Usage of MVVM.

• Light/dark theme support.
